## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fluid typography
- Accessibility

### What I learned

Hmm ðŸ¤” ...

- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) - So many useful layout techniques throughout this resource.
  - [The Switcher](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/switcher/) - for the popular section
  - [The Sidebar](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/sidebar/) - for the main section with the new section as the sidebar to the highlight section
- [Document: scroll event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/scroll_event)
- [Using CSS counters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_counter_styles/Using_CSS_counters) - For the popular section item numbers, I replaed static/hard-coded values with a CSS counter. Kevin Powell's [Dynamic numbering with CSS counters](https://youtu.be/tnSzkAiiQ4w?si=OzzluJ9yBpA0-21X) video was super helpful.
- [Using HTML landmark roles to improve accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/aria-accessibility-html-landmark-roles/) - Made sure to use semantic HTML and to explicitly label each of the major region landmarks used in the design.

### Continued development

Specific areas that the solution should be improved (known issues):

- [Cards - Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/) - Improve the card component, in particular, so that the entire card is interactive (on hover, focus, etc.).
- Potentially animate the appearance of the mobile navigation menu.
- Have the box-shadow for the sticky header appear only on the bottom side (not on the right and left side).

More general ideas I want to consider:

### Useful resources

- [Accessibility Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/)
- [MDN Web Docs for CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Went here a lot to reference the different CSS properties and the shorthands, and all the great explanations about best practices.
- [MDN Guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [The Clamp Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - Used for all of fluid typography and fluid spacing calculations.
